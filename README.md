# Genre Detection Using Film Scripts
![](images/film_genre_image.jpg)


## Getting Started


### Prerequisites


### Introduction
Genres are one of the most important aspects or audiences and creators of films alike. They are an agreement between the creator and the audience of what to expect of the film. The genre helps set the tone for the film which in some ways acts as a guideline for the screenwriter. It is then used to help draw audiences in. The film industry is constantly looking for new ways to draw in an audience and establishing the genre is one of the primary ways of doing so. The motivation for this project comes from my personal interest in films and exploring ways for them to streamline their marketing processes. Using the script to detect the genre of the film will let the screenwriter and film studios know whether or not they are portraying the type of tone/project that they intended to portray. It will give a more definitive meaning to the word “genre.” This will also serve to help film studios be better able to identify the genres of their movies and be able to do it in an automated and standardized way. This type of classifier can be used to inform and enhance film recommendation systems by being able to create labels/tags instantly. This also helps better inform the viewers of the type of movie they are about to see.
